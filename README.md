# ChatGPT for Desktop
And yet another useless project by this fool. This is a cross-platform ChatGPT desktop application made with Tauri. \
Linux builds coming soon!
# Building
Make sure tauri-cli is installed on your system.
```bash
cargo install tauri-cli
```
And then just build it! (it might take a while depending on your hardware)
```bash
cargo tauri build
```
